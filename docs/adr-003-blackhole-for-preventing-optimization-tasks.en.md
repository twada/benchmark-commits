# Implementation Tasks for Blackhole Feature

This document tracks the implementation tasks for the blackhole feature described in [ADR-003](./adr-003-blackhole-for-preventing-optimization.en.md).

## Tasks

### Core Implementation

- [ ] Add `blackhole` function implementation to `suite-setup.mts`
- [ ] Update `BenchmarkArguments` interface to include `blackhole` function
- [ ] Add `blackhole` to the return value in the benchmark registration function

### Documentation Updates

- [ ] Update README.md with blackhole feature explanation and usage examples
- [ ] Add blackhole feature to the API reference documentation
- [ ] Add a section about preventing optimization to the "Key Features" section

### Testing

- [ ] Create unit tests for the blackhole function
- [ ] Add integration tests to verify that blackhole prevents optimization
- [ ] Create a benchmark comparison with and without blackhole to demonstrate its effectiveness

### Examples

- [ ] Update existing examples to use the blackhole feature
- [ ] Create a new example file specifically demonstrating optimization prevention
- [ ] Add comments explaining the importance of the blackhole feature

### TypeScript Types

- [ ] Update type exports in index.mts
- [ ] Ensure proper TypeScript typing throughout the codebase
- [ ] Verify that IDE autocompletion works correctly with the new parameter

### Release Preparation

- [ ] Update CHANGELOG.md with the new feature
- [ ] Determine if this is a minor or patch version update
- [ ] Create migration notes if needed

## Completion Criteria

- All tests pass
- Documentation is comprehensive and clear
- Examples demonstrate the feature properly
- TypeScript typing is accurate
- Code review feedback is addressed

## Notes

- The blackhole implementation should maintain the balance between preventing optimization and minimizing its own overhead
- Consider benchmarking the blackhole function itself to ensure it has minimal impact
- Ensure backward compatibility for users not using the blackhole feature
- Even if Benchmark.js already has internal optimization prevention mechanisms, the blackhole feature provides significant value:
  - It offers an explicit, standardized interface for consuming values
  - The implementation has minimal overhead
  - It provides future compatibility if we ever change the underlying benchmarking tool
  - It has educational value by explaining JIT optimization issues to users
